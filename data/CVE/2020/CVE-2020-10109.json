				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in python-twisted-web, where it does not correctly process HTTP requests with both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. When the requests sent from and to the python-twisted-web are processed by another component that correctly processes HTTP requests, for example, a proxy, back-end, or web application firewall, a remote attacker can use this flaw to perform an HTTP request smuggling attack. This flaw impacts the system differently based on the type of application and the infrastructure. \n            STATEMENT: Although Red Hat OpenStack Platform packages the flawed code, python-twisted's web.HTTP functionality is not used in the RHOSP environment.  For this reason, the RHOSP impact has been lowered to moderate and no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-twisted package .\n\nOpenShift Container Platform 4.3 and later includes `python-twisted` as a dependency of `python-prometheus_client` in Ironic container images, however the affected code is not used.\n\nRed Hat Satellite uses affected versions of `python-twisted` and  `python-twisted-web` modules in Pulp, however, it is not vulnerable since `http` modal of web implementation is not expose in product. Red Hat Satellite may update `python-twisted` and `python-twisted-web` in future.\n\nThis issue affects the version of python-twisted(embedded in calamari-server) shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2. However, calamari is no longer supported, hence the embedded python-twisted package will not be fixed.\n            MITIGATION: When python-twisted-web is used as the back-end of your infrastructure, you can partially mitigate the problem by ensuring that each request on the front-end component (e.g. proxy) is sent over a separate network connection to the python-twisted-web server. This will prevent interference between different users, but it will not prevent all possible attacks that can be performed, which would vary based on the infrastructure and application in use.",
