				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Spring Security in several versions, in the use of plain text passwords using the PlaintextPasswordEncoder. If an application is using an affected version of Spring Security with the PlaintextPasswordEncoder and a user has a null encoded password, an attacker can use this flaw to authenticate using a password of \"null.\" \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat OpenStack Platform's OpenDaylight versions 9 and 10 contain the vulnerable code. However, these OpenDaylight versions were released as technical preview with limited support and will therefore not be updated. Other OpenDaylight versions do not contain the vulnerable library.",
