Applications may be vulnerable when directly using the AuthenticatedVoter#vote passing a NULL authentication parameter. \n            STATEMENT: The AuthenticatedVoter class was deprecated since Spring Security 5.8 is used in favor of the AuthorizationManager class, which is not vulnerable to this issue.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example.
