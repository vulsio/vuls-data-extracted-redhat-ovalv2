				"title": "allows an attacker to bypass a proxy by providing a URL that responds with a redirect to a restricted host or IP address (low)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in nodejs-axios. The Axios NPM package contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability where an attacker is able to bypass a proxy by providing a URL that responds with a redirect to a restricted host or IP address. \n            STATEMENT: Whilst in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) the openshift4/ose-console container does include the vulnerable axios library, it does not use the vulnerable proxy functionality. Additionally, the console is behind OpenShift OAuth restricting access to authenticated users only and as such has been marked as Low impact. \n\nThe OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) kiali component also includes the vulnerable axios library. Similar to OCP, kiali does not make use of the proxy function and is behind OpenShift OAuth reducing the impact Low.\n            MITIGATION: A mitigation exists where by catching the error code returned by axios.request, it can be identified that there is a redirect. By updating the old request config with the new redirect path, the request can then be repeated with the traffic routed through the proxy. As identified by Marika in this GitHub comment: https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/3369#issuecomment-721748989.",
