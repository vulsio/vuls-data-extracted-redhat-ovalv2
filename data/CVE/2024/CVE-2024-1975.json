				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the bind9 package, where if a DNS server hosts a zone containing a \"KEY\" resource record or a DNS resolver utilizes the DNSSEC validate feature to validate a \"KEY\" resource record, a malicious client could exhaust the CPU resourced from the resolver by sending a stream of SIG(0) signed requests. This issue can lead to a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability in the BIND9 package is classified as an important severity issue due to its potential to significantly disrupt DNS services, which are critical for internet functionality. The flaw allows a malicious client to exploit the DNSSEC validation process by sending a stream of SIG(0) signed requests, leading to CPU exhaustion on the resolver. This can cause a denial-of-service (DoS), rendering the DNS server unable to respond to legitimate queries. Given the widespread use of BIND9 in both enterprise and public DNS infrastructure, the impact of such an attack can be extensive, affecting numerous users and services reliant on DNS resolution.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
