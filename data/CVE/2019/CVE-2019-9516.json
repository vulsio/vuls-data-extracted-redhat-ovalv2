				"title": "HTTP/2: 0-length headers lead to denial of service (important)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in HTTP/2. An attacker, sending a stream of header with a 0-length header name and a 0-length header value, could cause some implementations to allocate memory for these headers and keep the allocations alive until the session dies. The can consume excess memory, potentially leading to a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw has no available mitigation for nodejs package. It will be updated once the available fixes are released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections.\n\nThe nodejs RPM shipped in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 and 3.10 is not affected by this flaw as it does not contain the vulnerable code.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat Quay 3.0 uses Nginx 1.12 from Red Hat Software Collections. It will be updated once a fixed is released for Software Collections. In the meantime users of Quay can disable http/2 support in Nginx by following these instructions:\n\n1. Copy the Nginx configuration from the quay container to the host\n$ docker cp 3aadf1421ba3:/quay-registry/conf/nginx/ /mnt/quay/nginx\n\n2. Edit the Nginx configuration, removing http/2 support\n$ sed -i 's/http2 //g' /mnt/quay/nginx/nginx.conf\n\n3. Restart Nginx with the new configuration mounted into the container, eg:\n$ docker run --restart=always -p 443:8443 -p 80:8080 --sysctl net.core.somaxconn=4096 -v /mnt/quay/config:/conf/stack:Z -v /mnt/quay/storage:/datastorage -v /mnt/quay/nginx:/quay-registry/config/nginx:Z -d quay.io/redhat/quay:v3.0.3",
