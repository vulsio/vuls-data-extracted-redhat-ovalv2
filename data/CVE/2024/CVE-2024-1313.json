Due to an error in authorization logic, it is possible for an unprivileged user in a different organization other than the snapshot owner to perform unauthorized actions such as deleting it using a view key. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates this as a Moderate impact flaw as it still require access to perform requests against Grafana and the view access key. The attacker would need minimum privileges in order to jeopardize an environment.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
