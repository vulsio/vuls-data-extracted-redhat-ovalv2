				"title": "python-cryptography: NULL pointer dereference with pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates when called with a non-matching certificate and private key and an hmac_hash override (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was discovered in python-cryptography. A NULL pointer dereference can be triggered when a PKCS#12 key and certificate do not match. Specifically, if the pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates function is called with a non-matching certificate and private key and an encryption algorithm with hmac_hash set, the Python process may crash, leading to a denial of service. \n            STATEMENT: The vulnerability in python-cryptography that leads to a NULL pointer dereference during the pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates function execution is classified as a moderate severity issue. While the vulnerability can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the Python process, it requires specific conditions to trigger: a mismatch between the provided certificate's public key and private key, coupled with the use of an encryption algorithm with hmac_hash set.\n\nThe exploitation of this vulnerability does not directly lead to arbitrary code execution or data leakage. Instead, it causes a controlled termination of the Python process, which, although disruptive, is not as critical as other vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized access, data corruption, or code injection. However, it's important to note that denial-of-service conditions can still have operational impacts, disrupting services or causing system instability.\n\nThis issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8 and 9 as we dont ship the vulnerable code and package version.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
