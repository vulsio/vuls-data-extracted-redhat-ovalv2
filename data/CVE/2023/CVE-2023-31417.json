				"title": "Sensitive information in audit logs (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Elasticsearch package. Elasticsearch filters out sensitive information and credentials before logging into the audit log. It was found that this filtering was not applied when requests to Elasticsearch use certain deprecated URIs for APIs. As a result, sensitive information such as passwords and tokens might be printed in cleartext in Elasticsearch audit logs. \n            STATEMENT: The audit logging is disabled by default and needs to be explicitly enabled and even when audit logging is enabled, request bodies that could contain sensitive information are not printed to the audit log unless explicitly configured. Hence, the impact is set to Moderate.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base, or stability. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
