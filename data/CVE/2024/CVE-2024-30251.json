				"title": "aiohttp: DoS when trying to parse malformed POST requests (moderate)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: An infinite loop flaw was found in aiohttp when handling POST (multipart/form-data) requests. This flaw allows an attacker to send a specially crafted request, leading the server to enter an infinite loop and render it unable to process any further requests. This denial of service can be triggered by a single unauthenticated POST request.\n\nAIOHTTP handles multipart strings through a process of segmenting them into chunks. The reading of each chunk is performed under the control of an asynchronous wait, ensuring that the operation completes before proceeding. A vulnerability was identified where a specially crafted request could trigger an infinite loop due to improper detection of the end-of-file (EOF) marker within the content.\n\nThe resolution involves the implementation of an enhanced checking mechanism. This mechanism correctly assigns the EOF marker to the chunk in question upon the successful completion of content reading, thereby preventing the infinite loop scenario. \n            STATEMENT: Red Hat rates the security impact of this vulnerability as Important due to the worst case scenario resulting in a denial of service. It is simple to exploit and could significantly impact availability. In order to exploit the bug, the attacker has to send a specially crafted POST request causing the server to go into an infinite loop.\n\nRed Hat Satellite has set a moderate impact of this issue as invalid requests which could trigger this bug such as no authentication or wrong path are unlikely possible or going to happen.",
