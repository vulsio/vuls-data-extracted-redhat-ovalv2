				"title": "Job Plugin (important)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Jenkins Pipeline: Job Plugin. Affected versions of Jenkins Pipeline: Job Plugin are vulnerable to Cross-site scripting caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. This flaw allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject malicious script into a Web page, which would then be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site once the page is viewed. The attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials. \n            STATEMENT: OpenShift 3.11 is in ELS. Jenkins and its related technologies will not be supported under ELS. Hence, OpenShift 3.11 is marked as affected/won'tfix.",
