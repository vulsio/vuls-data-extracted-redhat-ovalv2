				"title": "CVE-2014-6439 Elasticsearch: CSRF via insecure CORS default configuration (low)",
				"description": "DOCUMENTATION: The MITRE CVE dictionary describes this issue as: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the CORS functionality in Elasticsearch before 1.4.0.Beta1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors. \n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of elasticsearch as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6.x and Subscription Asset Manager 1.x. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n            MITIGATION: As provided at http://www.elasticsearch.org/community/security/,\n\nUsers should either set \"http.cors.enabled\" to false, or set \"http.cors.allow-origin\" to the value of the server that should be allowed access, such as localhost or a server hosting Kibana. Disabling CORS entirely with the former setting is more secure, but may not be suitable for all use cases.\n\nFor Satellite 6.x and Sam 1.x you can simply firewall elasticsearch to trusted users only (e.g. root, katello, foreman).
